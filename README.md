# Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to put together a solid business proposal for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. One of the key stakeholders would like to see a rundown of our analysis.

The first image I would like to describe is a visual of Trips by Weekday per Hour. It appear that there are many different positives to see here. During the days of Monday-Friday, there are two times of day that see big ramps in trips. Our peak hours have two different time frames. The first being in the morning between the hours of 6am to 10am. The second being in the afternoon between the hours of 5pm to 8pm. Saturdays and Sundays see most of their trips being taken for a majority of the mid-day between the hours of 10am and 7pm.

The second image I would like to describe is a visual of Trips by Gender(Weekday per hour). Based on the data shown in the image, Males take the most trips during the peak hours of 6am to 10am and 5pm to 8pm from Monday-Friday. Males also tend to have more trips on Saturdays between the hours of 11am to 6pm. Sundays are the most average amount of trips between all genders.

The third image I would like to describe is a visual of the total amount of bike trips each bike has been on. I believe that this is an essential part of keeping the business up and running. Bikes that are being taken on many rides have to be well maintained and repaired frequently. As bikes get older, we will have to make sure they are being replaced with new ones.

The final image I would like to describe is a dashboard of what I believe to be some of the most important and essential pieces of information that we will need so we understand how we can run our business at its highest profitability.

Attached is a link to my Tableau page where each of these images will have interactive compatibility so you can understand the data better!
